I am a master's student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, graduating in Fall 2020. I interned with Qualcomm's Multimedia R&D team this summer. Currently, I am looking for full-time opportunities in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Robotic Vision.

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the Robotics Algorithms & Autonomous Systems Lab with Dr. Pratap Tokekar, developing methodologies for Joint Perception and Robotic Vision. My research interests include AI, computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and robotics applications in solving real-world problems.

I am highly skilled in PyTorch, Python, C, C++, and MATLAB and have experience working with OpenCV, ROS, Git, AirSim, Agisoft Metashape, Algorithms, Tensor Flow, and Ubuntu.
